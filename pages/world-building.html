                            <p>The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan has surprised me in the best ways. The way he portrays the characters as real people is so beautiful. You feel as if you've lived in the Two Rivers your whole life, and feel the excitement
                                at the festival that is coming up. Suddenly, the uncertainty and fear that comes from the man in black, and the sudden attacks from the trollocs. This picturesque life is thrown into chaos.</p>
                            <p>Morraine's appearance and the subsequent flight from the town gives the perfect excuse for the classic epic journey that is the staple of any good fantacy. As you travel with this band of friends you come to know their character
                                and motovations. The excitement that comes from feeling Eugiane using the one power for the first time in making the rock flicker was palpable. Don't even get me started on how Matt complains all the time.</p>
                            <p>If I had to sum up my experiences with the Eye of the World, I would praise the pathos created by Robert Jordan. I honestly have felt a connection to the characters, and genuinely want to learn more about what will happen to
                                them. The Dark One is a long way off but I am honestly scared of him, and the characters should be too.</p>

                            <p> Roshar is one of my favorite fantacy worlds that I have ever read or heard about. Essentially, it is a planet that is in a perpetual cycle of storm, but not the same sort of storm that exists on Earth, and it's called a highstorm.
                                A highstorm is more intense than a hurricane and many times more deadly. Its stormwall spans hundreds of feet in the air, picking up boulders and anything else not locked down.</p>
                            <p>The plantlife has adapted to survive in creative ways. Grass sucks itself back in to the rock beneath it, and all the soil has been mostly blown away. The animal life all naturally live in burrows, and some trees fold completely
                                over to let the storm pass it by.</p>
                            <p>Humanity has adapted to the ecology as well. Every house is built either against a cliff overhang, or heavily reinforced stormside and not a single window faces East. Cities have been built, but they've been built into the
                                sides of mountains or in natural ruts, all in the effort to escape the highstorms.</p>
                            <p>The plot of the books follows the relationship between humanity and the spren that live there, and their efforts to survive an eternal war.</p>
